BitTorrent stuff on the internet, like games, movies, books, and other things, get updated all randomly and stuff.

I've tried a few file sharing apps, and they all have their pros and cons. After weighing my options, I decided to go with BitTorrent.

- Resilio Sync is convenient for syncing files, but its program optimization is poor, and it often hogs a lot of CPU power.
- IPFS tends to lose files easily (important files require double backup), and file management is really inconvenient.
